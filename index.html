  <h2>
First stop, Göreme
  </h2>
  <p>
    Part of the Cappadocia area, Göreme, is a small village with warm people. Famous for cave hotels, Pigeon Valley and sunrise hot air ballooning over the unique picturesque valley landscapes. Göreme National Park was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985. The nearest airports are Nevşehir Kapadokya Airport and Kayseri Airport. The village is also served by long-distance buses from all over Turkey. The malleable nature of the rocks and cones in and around Göreme has meant that people have carved out cave homes here from at least the third century. The houses were designed to suit a place-specific way of life, with mangers for the animals cut from the rock along with presses used to tread grapes and later to make pekmez (grape molasses). Tandir ovens cut into the floors doubled as heating. This was a way of life that continued right into the first decade of the 21st century but that came to an effective end as a result of a tourism boom that saw almost all the old houses converted into boutique hotels by around 2015*.

<h3>
  Sunrise Hot Air Balloning
</h3>  
<p>
  This was the reason we travelled to the Cappadocia region, to experience a sunrise hot air balloon over the stunning rock formations. The experience didn't disappoint, we were picked up from the hotel at 4am and given some light refreshments in the field where we watched the balloons inflate. After a short safety briefing, we jumped in the basket and were in awe for the rest of the beautiful scenic journey. Once we safely landed, we all cheered with a glass of champagne!

<h4>My Review</h4>
<p>
  Prepare yourself for an early start, but I promise, it is so worth it! This was a once in a lifetime experience for me, so magical I wont ever forget that floating feeling and the beautiful scenary.

<h3>
  Hiking in Pigeon Valley
</h3>  
<p>
  The 9km hiking trail is well signposted. We followed the trail to the viewpoint, which provided views of the region and Uçhisar Castle. At the viewpoint, you see a tree decorated with evil eyes. They are said to ward off bad energy. There are also a few stalls which are selling souvenirs and a small cafe, which provided much needed cold water to quench our thirst. The white rock did produce some heat in the valley and we travelled in July. The hike would suit most fitness levels, and took around 3 hours.</p>
<h4>My Review </h4>
<p>
  This hike is the perfect way to see the rock formations that are unique to this region. Take water and hat in summer. We loved this and highly recommend it.
